PPINOT Ontology
======

A key aspect in any process-oriented organisation is the measurement of process performance for the achievement of its
strategic and operational goals. Process Performance Indicators (PPIs) are a key asset to carry out this evaluation,
and, therefore, the management of these PPIs throughout the whole BP lifecycle is crucial.

[PPINOT](http://github.com/isa-group/ppinot) is a set of libraries aimed at facilitating and automating the PPI management. The support includes their
definition using either a graphical or a template-based textual notation, their automated analysis at design-time, and
their automated computation based on processing an event log obtained from a process simulator or a Business Process
Management System.

PPINOT ontology is an OWL ontology based on the PPINOT metamodel. It has been developed to enable design-time analysis
of PPIs defined with PPINOT using off-the-shelf OWL Reasoners. It also includes an use case showing how it can be used.

The project [ppinot-xml-owl](https://github.com/isa-group/ppinot-xml-owl) is an implementation that automatically generates an OWL ontology of a business process and a set of PPIs. However, it is currently obsolete and needs to be updated to the current version of PPINOT.
